<H3>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</H3>
<hr>

<H3>Mat Kilau</H3>

<p>Now I am not one to severely criticise action films. I enjoy my fair share of dumb action flicks I could turn off my critical brain to. If it gets the job done, and the film doesn't aspire to be remembered for its dialogue, I also don't mind the heavy exposition.</P>

    <H3>One Piece Film Red</H3>
    <P>While they delved into more of a musical theme than previous films overall it was great! They had a diverse song lineup, great fights, saw some memorable characters, and it always kept you interested from beginning to end. A great film no matter how much you know about the anime/manga.</P>

    <H3>Suzune</H3>

    <P>An experience I would welcome anytime , although slightly spooky feeling and having to watch with subtitles did give me a slight headache so I wonâ€™t be doing that again too soon unless something exceptional arises. </P>
